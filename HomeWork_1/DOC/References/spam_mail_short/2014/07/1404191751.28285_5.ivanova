This may sound a little surprising to you but the bank 
or to be precise Martin Davies has admitted having a 
substantial sum of money in a holding account belonging 
to you. Kindly get back to me so that I can assist you in 
receiving these funds so that I will be adequately 
compensated by you in the end. 

I can guarantee you that! 

Sincerely, 

Adam Witkover.
