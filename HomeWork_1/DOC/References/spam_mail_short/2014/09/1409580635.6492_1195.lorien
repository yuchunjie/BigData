Hi Sir,
         My name is jaison kuriakose and I am a PhD student in information
systems in memorial university, Canada. As part of my PhD dissertation, I am
conducting a survey study on requirements engineering practices in open source
software development under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey Parsons. Below are
the details about the study. If possible, please consider participating. Thank
you.

Invitation message for participation in survey

Dear sir/madam,
 
You are invited to participate in a survey titled "requirements engineering
practices used in the development of open source software projects". This
survey is part of a PhD dissertation study on requirements gathering in open
source software development.
 
This survey contains questions about which requirements engineering practices
are being used during open source software development, how useful requirements
engineering practices are for open source software development and the problems
and issues that may arise while carrying out requirements gathering activities
during open source software development. The survey would take around twenty
minutes to complete. The questions are not mandatory. If you are interested in
participating in this survey, please fill out the survey by clicking on the
link below:
