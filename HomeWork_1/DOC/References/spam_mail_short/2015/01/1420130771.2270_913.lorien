 Do you want to get rid of your Tinnitus? 
























































































































of melancholy seclusion - whom, in farther requital, he has deposed,   and  whom,   if he dared, he would murder!" "I think not so ill of the Earl  of  Murray, "  said  Roland   0cye82nu1  


Graeme; "and sooth to speak," he added, with a smile, "it would  n7u1   n7u1  require some  bribe   90cye827u1  to  make me embrace, with firm and desperate resolution,   either  one  side  or  the  other. " 


"Nay, if that is all, "  replied  Catherine  Seyton,   in  a tone of enthusiasm, "you  2n7u1  shall be guerdoned  with  prayers  from  oppressed  subjects  -  from 


dispossessed clergy - from insulted nobles - with immortal  praise   n7u1  by  future  ages  - with eager gratitude by the present  -  with  fame  on  earth,  e82n7u1    and  with  felicity  in 


heaven! Your country will thank you - your Queen will be debtor to you  -  you  will  achieve  at once the highest from the lowest degree in  e82n7u1  chivalry - all men willhonour,   all  women  will 


love you - and I, sworn with you  so  early  to  the  accomplishment  of  Queen    Mary’s hidom, will - yes, i will  e82n7u1  - love you better than - ever sister  loved  brother!"   e82n7u1  "Say  on  - 


say on!" cye82n71  whispered Roland, kneeling on one knee, and taking her hand,  which,   in  the warmthof exhortation, Catherine held towards him. 


"Nay," said she, pausing, "I have already said  too  much  - far too much, if I prevail not with you - far too little if I do.   But  I  prevail, "  she   82n7u1  


continued, seeing that the countenance  of  the  youth  she  addressed  returned    the enthusiasm of her own -"I prevail; or  rather  90cye827u1   the  good  cause  prevails  through   its  cye82n71     own 


strength - thus I devote thee  0cye82nu1  to it." And as she spoke she approached her finger to  the  brow  of  cye82n71  the astonished youth, and, without touching it, signed the cross  0cye82nu1  over  his  forehead  - 


stooped her face towards him, and seemed  to  kiss  the  empty  space  in  which  she  had traced the symbol; then starting up, and extricating herself from his   90cye827u1  grasp,   82n7u1   darted  into  the 


Queen’s apartment. Roland Graeme  remained  as  the  enthusiastic  maiden   82n7u1  had left him, kneeling on one knee, with breath withheld, and with eyes  fixed  0cye82nu1   upon  the  space 


which the fairy form of Catherine Seyton had so lately occupied.   If  his  2n7u1   thoughts were not of unmixed delight, they at least partook of that   90cye827u1   n7u1  thrilling  and  intoxicating, 


though mingled sense of pain and pleasure, the most over-poweringwhich  life  offers  in its blended cup. He rose and retired slowly; and although the  chaplain  Mr.    90cye827u1  Henderson 


preached on that evening his best sermon against the  errors  0cye82nu1   of  Popery,    90cye827u1  I  would  not engage that he was followed accurately  through  the   90cye827u1  train  of  his  reasoning  by  the 


young proselyte, with a view to whose  especial  benefit   2n7u1  he  had  handled   the    subject. 28 Gan, Gano, or Ganelon of Mayence,   is  in  the  Romances 



on the subject of Charlemagne and his Paladins,  always  represented   e82n7u1  as  the  traitor   82n7u1  by whom the Christian champions are betrayed. And  when  love’s  torch  hath  set  the  heart   n7u1  in   0cye82nu1   flame, 



Comes  Seignor   cye82n71  Reason,   with  his  saws   and    cautions, Giving such  aid  as    the    old    gray-beard   saxaphoneton, Who  from  the  church-vault  drags  the    crazy    engine,
