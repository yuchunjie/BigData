slashes, and broken bones. Men call the old haga prophetess -  I  do   mj9dwyq  scarce  believe  she could foretell when a brood of  9dwyq chickens will chip  the  dwyq   shell  -  Men  say  she  reads  the 


heavens - my black switch knows as much of them when she sits baying the  moon  -  Men  mj9dwyq   pretend the ancient wretch is a  b1mj9dwq  sorceress, a witch, and, what not -  Inter  nos  ,    9dwyq  I  will 


never contradict a rumour which may bring her to the stake which  she  so  justly  deserves; but neither  mj9dwyq  will I believe that the tales of witches  which  they  din  into  our  ears  are 


aught but knavery, cozenage, and old women's fables." "In the name of Heaven, what is she then,"  said  the  page, "that you make such  dwyq  a stir 



about her?" "She is  6hb1mj9wyq   one  of  those  cursed  old  women, "  replied  the Doctor, "who take currently  b1mj9dwq  and impudently upon themselves to act  as  advisers  and  curers 


of the sick, on the strength of some trash of herbs, some rhyme of spells,   some  julap  or diet, drink or cordial." "Nay,  go  no  farther, "   b1mj9dwq  said  the  page;  "if  they  brew 


cordials, evil be their lot and all their partakers!" "You say well, young man," said Dr. Lundin;  "for  mine  own part, I know no such pests to   b1mj9dwq  


the commonwealth as these old incarnate devils,   who   mj9dwyq  haunt the  j9dwyq  chambers of the brain-sick  dwyq  patients,  dwyq  that are mad enough to suffer  them  j9dwyq   to  interfere 


with, disturb,  dwyq  and let, the regular process of  dwyq  a  learned  and  artificial  cure,   with their  b1mj9dwq  sirups, and their julaps, and  diascordium,   and  9dwyq   mithridate,       and    6hb1mj9wyq   my    Lady 


What-shall-call'um's powder, and worthy Dame Trashem's pill;  and  thus  make  widows  and  orphans, and cheat the regular and well- studied physician, in order to get the name  of  wise  women   9dwyq  


and skeely neighbours,and so forth. But no more on't - Mother  Nicneven  30  and  I   b1mj9dwq  will meet one day, and she shall know there  is  hb1mj9dyq   danger  in  dealing    with    the    Doctor.  " 


"It is a true word, and  many  have  found  it, "  said  the page; "but under your favour, I would  fain  walk  abroad  for  a   j9dwyq  little,   and  see  these 


sports." "It is well moved," said  j9dwyq  the Doctor, "and I  too  6hb1mj9wyq   should  be showing myself abroad. Moreover the play waits us, young man-today,   totus   j9dwyq   hb1mj9dyq  mundus 


agit histrionem ."- And they sallied  forth  accordingly  into  the    mirthful    scene. 29 At  mj9dwyq  Scottish fairs, the bailie,  mj9dwyq   or  magistrate,   dwyq   deputed 


by the lord in whose name the meeting is held, attends the fair with  9dwyq  his  guard,   decides trifling disputes, and punishes  on  the  spot  any  petty  delinquencies.   9dwyq    b1mj9dwq     His 


attendants are usually armed with halberds, and sometimes,   at  least,   escorted  by  music.Thus, in the "Life and Death of Habbie  hb1mj9dyq  Simpson,"we are  told  of  that  famous  minstrel, - 



"At    fairs    he    play'd    before    the     spear-men, And gaily graithed in their gear-men;- Steel  bonnets,    j9dwyq  jacks,   and  swords  shone  clear   then, 




Like ony bead; Now wha shall play before sicweir-men, Since Habbie's dead! 30 This was the name given to the grand  j9dwyq  Mother  Witch,   the


very Hecate of Scottish popular superstition. Her name  was  bestowed,   6hb1mj9wyq   in  one  or two instances, upon sorceresses,  6hb1mj9wyq  who were held to resemble her by  their  superior  skill  in .
