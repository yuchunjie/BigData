Narcissus abscissus is a species of the genus Narcissus Daffodils in the family Amaryllidaceae. It is classified in Section Pseudonarcissus. It is native to France and Spain in the region of the Pyrenees.The 197879 British Home Championship was a British Home Nations competition, won by the English football side and notable for seeing marked increases in hooliganism and falling attendance which would result in its cancellation in 1984. The English started well, beating Northern Ireland to match the heavy Welsh victory over Scotland on the same day, which featured a hat trick by John Toshack. Scotland recovered by beating the Irish in their next match while England and Wales played out a goalless draw, leaving three sides theoretically capable of winning the Championship in the final round. Wales could only manage a draw with the Irish and so in the deciding match between England and Scotland, a 11 half time score gave the Scots some hope but a strong second half performance from England

Wales could only manage a draw with the Irish and so in the deciding match between England and Scotland, a 11 half time score gave the Scots some hope but a strong second half performance from England was rewarded with a deserved 31 win. This result gave England the Championship, with Wales in second place. The tournament also saw the introduction of goal difference to separate teams, although it had no effect on the eventual outcome.The points system worked as followsThe points system worked as followsThe points system worked as followsThe points system worked as followsOuassou is a town and subprefecture in the Dubrka Prefecture in the Kindia Region of western Guinea.The tomb of the Ancient Egyptian noble Ahmes Ahmose, known as Amarna Tomb 3, is located in the northern side of the wadi that splits the cluster of tombs known collectively as the Northern tombs, near to the city of Amarna, in Egypt.Ahmes was a sealbearer of the King of Lower Egypt, the sole companion, the attendant of the Lord of the Two Lands, the favorite of the good god, true king's scribe, steward in the house of Akhenaten, overseer of the front hall of the Lord of the Two Lands court of justice, and a fanbearer at the right hand of the king.Ahmes was a sealbearer of the King of Lower Egypt, the sole companion, the attendant of the Lord of the Two Lands, the favorite of the good god, true king's scribe, steward in the house of Akhenaten, overseer of the front hall of the Lord of the Two Lands court of justice, and a fanbearer at the right hand of the king.Ahmes was a sealbearer of the King of Lower Egypt, the sole companion, the attendant of the Lord of the Two Lands, the favorite of the good god, true king's scribe, steward in the house of Akhenaten, overseer of the front hall of the Lord of the Two Lands court of justice, and a fanbearer at the right hand of the king.Ahmes was a sealbearer of the King of Lower Egypt, the sole companion, the attendant of the Lord of the Two Lands, the favorite of the good god, true king's scribe, steward in the house of Akhenaten, overseer of the front hall of the Lord of the Two Lands court of justice, and a fanbearer at the right hand of the king.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
