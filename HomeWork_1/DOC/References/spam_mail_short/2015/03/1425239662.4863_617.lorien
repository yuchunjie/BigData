Since I've been out in this area a lot recently due to classes I'm taking, I was on the hunt for a place where I could get some great Mediterranean and I was fortunate to find this hidden jewel.  I had such a nice experience on my first visit that I've already been back a second time and plan to make this my go-to place for this type of food while I'm waiting for my songwriting classes to start.

They serve the usual plates like kabobs, shawarma, falafels and salads.  The shawarma I had was so moist and seasoned quite well.  You get your customary choice of rice pilaf and salad.  What I really love is the pita bread which is baked fresh, is on the thicker side and very fluffy.  It's really, really good to dip in the hummus that is also included with your meal.  It's probably the best pita bread I've had at any Mediterranean joint thus far.  Thinking about it, if they use this bread for their falafels which they probably do, then the falafels would taste killer!

Parking can be tight because it's in a strip mall off busy Cahuenga Blvd. but hey, the service is good and friendly and plus it's a comfortable ambiance inside the restaurant.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
