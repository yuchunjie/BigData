Diane was such a charming, kind and welcoming host into her store. She wanted me to try everything and kept her store open past closing time. She was such a beautiful person inside and out and took a special interest in my person. Now let's talk about the chocolate: as a French native, I'm usually very critical when it comes to chocolate, especially when American-made, but K Chocolatier was absolutely amazing - drops of deliciousness from heaven.  I had the truffles, which I think were the best in the world, and I also had the K bears, which were also amazing. The presentation is also very beautiful and elegant. Check out her store near Rodeo drive and in Malibu, you will be so happy you did!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

(Again, please no angry pitchfork mob of Franklin's fans at my front door!) I definitely do not think it is worth a 3 HOUR wait (maybe 30-45 min max) and for people to wake up at like 7 in the morning and bring their lawn chairs out here to form a line an hour before it opens... 

I am not saying that Franklin's is not good BBQ, because it is, but I have definitely had better BBQ experiences elsewhere, I personally feel that Franklin's is on the same level as Rudy's and a bit pricier as well. My friend woke up early and started lining up here well before it opened, and although we were one of the first people in line (maybe 10th?), it still took us about another hour or so after it opened for us to actually be able to order our food and get seats (so a total of about 3 hrs....). The store is pretty small and you technically can't get a table until after you have already ordered, so jump on those seats as soon as you order! 

The servers were really nice and offered us samples of the meat and I like how there are different levels of fattiness vs. lean meat! Personally, I prefer a little fat in my bbq cuz the meat is just more tender and juicy! My friend and I got the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork with a side of potato salad and coleslaw. 

First off, the brisket was pretty good, but again I think it is pretty much the same as Rudy's if not a little bit better. However, some pieces were quite rough, burnt, and hard to chew. The ribs were actually pretty good and the meat was tender and succulent! The pulled pork was good also, but pretty average so I wouldn't suggest getting it .As for the sides, they were also good, but average. I much prefer the side dishes and creamed corn from Rudy's. The bbq sauce was pretty good though and I do prefer it here over Rudy's typical bbq sauce.

Overall, Franklin's is a good BBQ place, but definitely not the best in Texas!f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
