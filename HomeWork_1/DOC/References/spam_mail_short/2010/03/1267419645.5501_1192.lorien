Are you surprised at these cheap prices? How can we offer those software products so cheaply, while the normal price is 5-20 times more expensive? It's very simple. First of all, our company and the European Manufacturer's Association have developed a special program of reducing prices for popular software in this period of world economic crisis. Secondly, all software are OEM versions. The OEM version was created for big corporations or big companies with many computers. It is not necessary for those companies to buy a User Guide and nice packaging for each computer, it is enough to buy one CD to install on to ALL their computers. In addition, clients who bought the full version pay for technical support and for different kinds of piffling bonuses from manufacturers. The OEM version doesn't have that which is why it can be sold for less. At the same time, on the menu you'll find detailed instructions on how to use the software, i.e. the User guide, so you lose nothing except the cost!
Please Note!! Our company provides technical support for installing our software. If you have any questions or problems with installing software, our technical support representatives will always help you!
