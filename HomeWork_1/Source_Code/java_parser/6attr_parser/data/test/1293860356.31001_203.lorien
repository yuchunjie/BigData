From: "James M. Burton" <jburton@bfsmedia.com>
Subject: Caribbean cell phone number (i think)

i think the number you will dial or text to reach me after midday the
2nd is:

011 509 36355047

011	011 is the international prefix used to dial somewhere outside
of Canada.
509	509 is the international code used to dial to Haiti.
3635504 is the local number

my phone was purchased in Haiti by my friend but will roam to the
digicel network in St. Kitts/Nevis and the first part of my time in
Antigua until i get an Antiguan SIM card

i will text Mike on Sunday to test - please confirm the number with the
other folks on this email if it works, Mike

i will then text or call Mike once I have the Antiguan SIM card - again,
please disseminate to this list - Eric, Shelley, Lorna, Mary

having fun

have a good new year
